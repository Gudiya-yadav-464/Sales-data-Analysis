Sales-data-analysis 

<br>
Hii everyone this project is all about sales analysis so let's talk about the data so i had tweleve csv files of sales data of every month so for analyse the data i have to merge the  data files into one file on the basis of same column after done this process.
<br>

I use python library numpy to cleaning and manipulating the data and for making some dashboards in python i use matplotlib library. I also use some other libraries.

<br>
So for analysing the data we have to give ans some of the following questions.

<br>

1. what was the best year for sales? How much was earned that year?<br>
2. what was the best month for sales? How much was earned that Month?<br>
3. Which City has the highest Number of sales?<br>
4. What time should we display advertisement to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product ?<br>
5. what product sold the most? why do you think it sold the most?<br>
6. How much probability for next people will order USB-C charging Cable?<br>
7. How much Probability for next people will order iPhone?<br>
8. How much probability for next people will order Google Phone ?<br>
9. How much Probability for next people will order Wired Headphones?
<br>


So these are the all question that we have to ans and i solved them using python so also check my python file Sales.ipynb file .
